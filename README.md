If you're scheduled for gallbladder removal surgery (also called cholecystectomy), it's completely normal to feel anxious and curious about whatâ€™s going to happen before and after the procedure. The good news? Itâ€™s one of the most common and safest surgeries done today, especially when performed laparoscopically (through small cuts).

Before the Surgery:
Before your surgery, your doctor will likely ask for some basic tests like blood work, an ultrasound, or sometimes even an MRI. Youâ€™ll also be advised to stop eating or drinking at least 6â€“8 hours before the surgery. Make sure you let your doctor know if youâ€™re on any medications, especially blood thinners. Some of these may need to be paused a few days before the operation.

Most gallbladder surgeries today are done as laparoscopic surgeries, which means smaller incisions, faster recovery, and less pain. The surgeon inserts a tiny camera and tools through 3â€“4 small cuts in your abdomen. In some rare cases (like if thereâ€™s a complication or severe infection), the surgery may need to be done with a bigger cut (open surgery).

After the Surgery:
Once the surgery is done, youâ€™ll be in a recovery room until the anesthesia wears off. You might feel groggy or tired, and some people have mild shoulder pain from the gas used during the laparoscopic procedure â€” donâ€™t worry, this usually fades in a day or two.

You may be able to go home the same day, or you might stay overnight depending on your health and how the surgery went. Youâ€™ll be advised to:

Walk around slowly to improve circulation

Avoid lifting heavy things for a few weeks

Follow a low-fat diet temporarily, as your body adjusts to digesting without a gallbladder

Your liver will still produce bile, but instead of storing it in the gallbladder, it flows directly into the intestine. Some people notice mild bloating or diarrhea for a few weeks, but most adjust quickly.

When to Call a Doctor:
If you notice severe pain, fever, redness near your incision, or yellowing of your eyes/skin (jaundice), contact your doctor immediately. These could be signs of infection or bile duct issues.
